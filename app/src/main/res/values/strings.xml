Though it will increase battery usage insignificantly and traffic usage proportionally to the total count of unread messages you have, hence this will work only with WIFI connection by, until you allow to use cell network in settings.\n\nIf you have many unread messages, and want to use this option, I highly recommend you use \"Read All\" option on the Eljur website.\n\nDo you want to enable this option? You can always turn it on/off in settings</string>
